[Never](https://never-lang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a simple functional 
programming language. Technically it may be classified as syntactically scoped,
strongly typed, call by value, functional programming language.

In practise Never offers basic data types, assignment, control flow, arrays,
first order functions and some mathematical functions to make it useful
to calculate expressions. Also it demonstrates how functions can be compiled,
invoked and passed as parameters or results between other functions.

## Getting Started
It is easy to download and compile Never language. Just clone repository
and make the compiler in a few basic steps. To read more visit
